## Why Use Adobe Type Manager?
 
Adobe Type Manager is a useful tool for anyone who works with graphics, design, or publishing. It allows you to use high-quality PostScript fonts on your Windows computer, which can enhance the appearance and readability of your documents. PostScript fonts are vector-based, which means they can be scaled to any size without losing quality. They also support advanced features such as kerning, ligatures, and glyphs.
 
With ATM, you can install and manage PostScript fonts easily. You can preview fonts before installing them, organize them into groups, and activate or deactivate them as needed. You can also use ATM to print documents with PostScript fonts on any printer, even if it does not support PostScript.
  
## What Are the Alternatives to Adobe Type Manager?
 
If you do not want to use Adobe Type Manager on Windows 7 64-bit, you have some other options. One of them is to use OpenType fonts instead of PostScript fonts. OpenType fonts are compatible with Windows 7 64-bit and do not require any additional software. They also have many of the same features as PostScript fonts, such as kerning, ligatures, and glyphs. However, OpenType fonts may not have the same quality or variety as PostScript fonts.
 
Another option is to use a third-party font manager that supports PostScript fonts on Windows 7 64-bit. There are several font managers available online, such as Suitcase Fusion, FontExpert, or MainType. These programs can help you install and manage PostScript fonts on your computer. However, they may not be as reliable or compatible as Adobe Type Manager.
